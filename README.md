# JSON RESTful Web Service Implementation using Rails

Created using [Rails::API](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api), a subset of a normal Rails application.

Tested using [REST Client](https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client).

Access web services locally ```http://0.0.0.0:3000/api/customers/```
